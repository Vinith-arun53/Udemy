(in ArticleController create action)
//we need to whitelist the params that we are gonna use to create a article.
def create
	@article = Article.new(params.require(:article).permit(:title, :description))
	render plain: @article.inspect //to just view the article
end
//this will just save the article to the db and will not redirect to the article view page. 
//So we need to redirect to the Article view page using the redirect_to method.
(inside the create action, after saving the article)
redirect_to article_path(@article) //redirect_to @article is a alternative way
